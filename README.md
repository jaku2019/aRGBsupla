# WS2812B adressible LEDs Supla based ESP32 controller
Forked from @radzik_r (forum.supla.org). Supports GUI pin configuration.
The button allows you to 
- switch between animaations (if any of them is currently on) with a **short press** and
- toggle the light (ON/OFF) with a **long press**.
If turned on with the button, the light enters "normal" Supla-controlled RGB mode.
